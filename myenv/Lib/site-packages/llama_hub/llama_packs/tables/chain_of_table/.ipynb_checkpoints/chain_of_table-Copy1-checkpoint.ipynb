    "In this notebook we highlight our implementation of the (\"Chain of Table\" paper by Wang et al.)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04398v1.pdf].\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain-of-Table proposes the following: given a user query over tabular data, plan out a sequence of tabular operations over the table to retrieve the right information in order to satisfy the user query. The updated table is explicitly used/modified throughout the intermediate chain (unlike chain-of-thought/ReAct which uses generic thoughts). \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a fixed set of tabular operations that are defined in the paper:\n",
    "- `f_add_column`\n",
    "- `f_select_row`\n",
    "- `f_select_column`\n",
    "- `f_group_by`\n",
    "- `f_sort_by`\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented the paper based on the prompts described in the paper, and adapted it to get it working. That said, this is marked as beta, so there may still be kinks to work through. Do you have suggestions / contributions on how to improve the robustness? Let us know! "
