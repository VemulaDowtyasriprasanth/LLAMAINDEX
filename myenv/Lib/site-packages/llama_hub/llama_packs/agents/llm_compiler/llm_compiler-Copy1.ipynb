       "ToolOutput(content=\"As of 2020, Boston had an estimated population of 691,531 residents living in 266,724 households, marking a 12% increase from 2010. It is the third-most densely populated large U.S. city with over half a million residents and the most densely populated state capital. The population distribution is as follows: 21.9% are 19 and under, 14.3% are from 20 to 24, 33.2% are from 25 to 44, 20.4% are from 45 to 64, and 10.1% are 65 years or older. The median age is 30.8 years. For every 100 females, there are 92.0 males, and for every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 89.9 males. The median household income is $51,739, and the median income for a family is $61,035. The per capita income is $33,158. 21.4% of the population and 16.0% of families are below the poverty line. The city has a significant racial wealth gap, with White Bostonians having a median net worth of $247,500 compared to $8 for non-immigrant Black residents and $0 for Dominican immigrant residents.

The city is the third-most densely populated large U.S. city of over half a million residents, and the most densely populated state capital. Some 1.2 million persons may be within Boston's boundaries during work hours, and as many as 2 million during special events. This fluctuation of people is caused by hundreds of thousands of suburban residents who travel to the city for work, education, health care, and special events.In the city, the population was spread out, with 21.9% at age 19 and under, 14.3% from 20 to 24, 33.2% from 25 to 44, 20.4% from 45 to 64, and 10.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30.8 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.9 males. There were 252,699 households, of which 20.4% had children under the age of 18 living in them, 25.5% were married couples living together, 16.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 54.0% were non-families. 37.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.26 and the average family size was 3.08.The median household income in Boston was $51,739, while the median income for a family was $61,035. Full-time year-round male workers had a median income of $52,544 versus $46,540 for full-time year-round female workers. The per capita income for the city was $33,158. 21.4% of the population and 16.0% of families were below the poverty line. Of the total population, 28.8% of those under the age of 18 and 20.4% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line. Boston has a significant racial wealth gap with White Bostonians having an median net worth of $247,500 compared to an $8 median net worth for non-immigrant Black residents and $0 for Dominican immigrant residents.From the 1950s to the end of the 20th century, the proportion of non-Hispanic Whites in the city declined. In 2000, non-Hispanic Whites made up 49.5% of the city's population, making the city majority minority for the first time. However, in the 21st century, the city has experienced significant gentrification, during which affluent Whites have moved into formerly non-White areas. In 2006, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated non-Hispanic Whites again formed a slight majority but as of 2010, in part due to the housing crash, as well as increased efforts to make more affordable housing more available, the non-White population has rebounded. This may also have to do with increased Latin American and Asian populations and more clarity surrounding U.S. Census statistics, which indicate a non-Hispanic White population of 47% (some reports give slightly lower figures).\", start_char_idx=24431, end_char_idx=27320, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.8134826614370985), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='2c636145-ac04-4853-bcf4-290f4431f173', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='b7406038-e187-4ab2-852b-422a6cafbaf5', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={}, hash='fb692198d3ccd82073c7de83a85e36f75c77acda999795902a28e1ad342cf1c4'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='1cd9ef53-f7b9-4a72-a6dc-586e99b3150d', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='7b809ad6fce81bf0205a13efbaed0672820d837b47a00b6df0ae4e9858d24929'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='f1617774-b90a-4f9c-9cd7-e85d9f423d66', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='f76387df21f053afe785a9bb2093e0953d4b8ad53481760b88dda9359e76dfd3')}, hash='a5c9eb4e50dca12ef8423cbdfcea156013daa1791560f4961d4d4f1e90516b70', text=\"=== Ethnicity ===\\nAfrican-Americans comprise 22% of the city's population.
