Never directly reference the given context in your answer.\\\\n2. Avoid statements like \\'Based on the context, ...\\' or \\'The context information ...\\' or anything along those lines.Context information is below.\\\\n---------------------\\\\nSo we can think of slow wave sleep as important for motor learning, motor skill learning and for the learning of specific details about specific events.And this turns out to be fundamentally important because now we know that slow wave sleep is primarily in the early part of the night, and motor learning is occurring primarily early in the night, and detailed learning is occurring early in the night.Now for those of you that are waking up after only three, four hours of sleep, this might be informative.This might tell you a little something about what you are able to learn and not able to learn if that were to be the only sleep that you get.Although, hopefully that\\'s not the only sleep that you get.But we\\'re going to dive deep into how it is that one can maximize motor learning in order to extract say, more detail information about coordinated movements and how to make them faster or slower.So that might be important for certain sports.It might be almost certainly important for certain sports.It\\'s gonna be important for any kind of coordinated movement, like say learning to play the piano, or for instance, how to learn synchronized movements with somebody else.So maybe I mentioned the example of dance earlier.Like me a few years ago, I set out to learn tango because I have some Argentine relatives and I was a Bismal.I need to return to that at some point.I was just a Bismal.And one of the worst things about being a bismal at learning dance is that, that somebody else has to suffer the consequences also.So I don\\'t know maybe in the month on neuroplasticity, I\\'ll explore that again as a self experimentation.But, the key things to know are slow wave sleep is involved in motor learning and detailed learning.There\\'s no acetylcholine around at that time, has these big amplitude activity sweeping throughout the brain and that there\\'s the release of these neuromodulators, norepinephrine and serotonin.And again, that\\'s all happening early in the night.So athletes, people that are concerned about performance, if you happen to wake up after just a couple hours of, you know, three, four hours of sleep because you\\'re excited about a competition the next day, presumably if you\\'ve already trained the skills that you need for the event you should be fine to engage in that particular activity.Now it\\'s always going to be better to get a full night\\'s sleep.And that, you know, a full night\\'s sleep for you is six hours then it\\'s always gonna be better to get more sleep than it is to get less.However, I think some people get a little bit overly concerned that if they didn\\'t get their full night\\'s sleep before some sort of physical event that their performance is going to plummet.Presumably, if you\\'ve already learned what you need to do, and it\\'s stored in your neural circuits and you know how to make those coordinated movements, what the literature on slow wave sleep suggest is that you would be replenished.That the motor learning and the recovery from exercise is going to happen early in the night.Okay.So we\\'ll just pause there, and kind of shelve that for a moment and then we\\'re gonna come back to it.But I wanna talk about REM sleep, or rapid eye movement sleep.REM sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, as I mentioned before, occurs throughout the night, but you\\'re gonna have more of it.A larger percentage of these 90 minute sleep cycles is going to be comprised of REM sleep as you get toward morning.REM sleep is fascinating.It was discovered in \\'50s when a sleep laboratory in Chicago, the researchers observed that people\\'s eyes were moving under their eyelids.Now, something very important that we\\'re going to address when we talk about trauma later is that, the eye movements are not just side to side they\\'re very erratic in all different directions.One thing that I don\\'t think I\\'ve never heard anyone really talk about publicly is, why eye movements during sleep, right?Eyes are closed.And sometimes people\\'s eyelids will be a little bit open and their eyes are darting around, especially in little kids.I don\\'t suggest you do this.I\\'m not even sure it\\'s ethical.But, it has been done where you, you know, pull back the eyelids of a kid while they\\'re sleeping and their eyes are kind of darting all over the place.I think people do this to their passed out friends at parties and things like that.So again, I don\\'t suggest you do it, but I\\'m telling you it because it\\'s been done before and therefore you don\\'t have to do it again.But rapid eye movement sleep is fascinating and occurs because there are connections between the brainstem, an area called the pons, and areas of the thalamus and the top of the brain stem that are involved in generating movements in different directions, sometimes called saccades.\\\\n\\\\nAre they quite different than the patterns of sleep and dreaming that occur later in the night or toward morning?Well, okay, that\\\\u2019s an interesting question.There\\'S a lot of facets to it.There is some evidence that the first four hours of sleep are very important for memory processing and in fact, if you\\'ve learned something new that day or have experienced a new sensory motor experience, then your early sleep dreams will incorporate that experience.Much more than the later sleep dreams later, as that memory gets Consolidated from the early structures, which are the hippocampus deep in the temporal lobe to the cortex in a distributed fashion.That memory seems to move from that hippocampus to the cortex and also the dreams that incorporate that memory also move later in the night.So nobody knows why, but it does.There was a great study by siddarta Ribeiro who studied the consolidation of memories from the cortex from the hippocampus to the cortex in a rat across the period of a full day.Sleep because rats sleep in the daytime and he found that each subsequent Rim sleep period, moved that memory, a from the hippocampus to the first first area, that projects to it and then the second area.And then the third area.And you can see the memory moving Um through the throughout the Sleep cool period, yeah very cool, so you have to read that study.So um there\\'s a number of different hormones associated with the different stages of sleep.We know that melatonin is a hormone of nighttime of nighttime.That makes a sleepy um what about growth hormone release when does that occur during sleep, so growth hormone release happens all day, long and all night long, but the Deep, slow way sleep that you get.The very first sleep cycle is when you get a big bolus of growth, hormone release and in men and women equally, and if you miss that first deep, slow way sleep period, you also miss that big bolus of growth hormone release and you might get ultimately across The day, just as much overall growth hormone release, but endocrinologists will tell you that big boluses do different things than a little bit eeked out over time.So that is well.We know, there\\'s also a big push to synthesize proteins.So that\\\\u2019s when the protein synthesis part that builds memories, for example in our brain, happens in that first cycle of sleep.So you don\\'t want to miss that, especially if you\\'ve learned something really big and needs needs more synaptic space to encode it.How would somebody miss that first 90 minutes driving themselves yeah?So so let\\'s say I normally go to sleep at 10 pm and then from 10 to 11 30 would be this first phase of sleep and that\\\\u2019s when the growth hormone, big bolus of growth hormone would be released.Does that mean that if I go to sleep instead at 11, 30 or midnight that I miss that first phase of sleep, why is it not the case that I get that first phase of sleep just simply starting later?It is a beautiful clock that we have in our body.That knows when things should happen, and it\\\\u2019s every cell in our body has a clock and all those clocks are normally synchronized and the Circadian clocks are synchronized, and so our cells are ready to respond onto that growth hormone release at a particular time, and if we Miss it and it\\\\u2019s a time in relation to melatonin also so if you miss it yeah you might get some growth hormone release, but it\\\\u2019s occurring at a time when that your clock has already moved to the next phase, and so it\\\\u2019s it\\\\u2019s just a clock thing.Yeah, I don\\'t think we can overstate the importance of what you just described and to be honest, despite knowing a bit about the Sleep, research and circadian biology.This is the very first time that I\\'ve ever heard this that if you normally go to sleep at a particular time and growth hormone is released in that first phase of sleep that you can\\'t simply initiate your sleep bout later and expect to capture that first phase Of sleep yeah, that\\\\u2019s incredible and I think important and um, as many listeners are probably realizing, also highly actionable.So what this means is that we should have fairly consistent bedtimes in addition to fairly consistent, wait times.Is that right exactly and in fact one of the Best markers of good neurological health when we get older, is consistent, bedtimes, wow, okay, um.I don\\'t want to backtrack, but I did write down something that I think is important for me to resolve or for you to resolve.So I\\'m going to ask this um people that sleep, nine hours or more perhaps that reflecting an issue.Some underlying issue, perhaps is being a teenager or an adolescent

important for motor learning, motor skill learning and for the learning of specific details about specific events.And this turns out to be fundamentally important because now we know that slow wave sleep is primarily in the early part of the night, and motor learning is occurring primarily early in the night, and detailed learning is occurring early in the night.Now for those of you that are waking up after only three, four hours of sleep, this might be informative.This might tell you a little something about what you are able to learn and not able to learn if that were to be the only sleep that you get.Although, hopefully that's not the only sleep that you get.But we're going to dive deep into how it is that one can maximize motor learning in order to extract say, more detail information about coordinated movements and how to make them faster or slower.So that might be important for certain sports.It might be almost certainly important for certain sports.It's gonna be important for any kind of coordinated movement, like say learning to play the piano, or for instance, how to learn synchronized movements with somebody else.So maybe I mentioned the example of dance earlier.Like me a few years ago, I set out to learn tango because I have some Argentine relatives and I was a Bismal.I need to return to that at some point.I was just a Bismal.And one of the worst things about being a bismal at learning dance is that, that somebody else has to suffer the consequences also.So I don't know maybe in the month on neuroplasticity, I'll explore that again as a self experimentation.But, the key things to know are slow wave sleep is involved in motor learning and detailed learning.There's no acetylcholine around at that time, has these big amplitude activity sweeping throughout the brain and that there's the release of these neuromodulators, norepinephrine and serotonin.And again, that's all happening early in the night.So athletes, people that are concerned about performance, if you happen to wake up after just a couple hours of, you know, three, four hours of sleep because you're excited about a competition the next day, presumably if you've already trained the skills that you need for the event you should be fine to engage in that particular activity.Now it's always going to be better to get a full night's sleep.And that, you know, a full night's sleep for you is six hours then it's always gonna be better to get more sleep than it is to get less.However, I think some people get a little bit overly concerned that if they didn't get their full night's sleep before some sort of physical event that their performance is going to plummet.Presumably, if you've already learned what you need to do, and it's stored in your neural circuits and you know how to make those coordinated movements, what the literature on slow wave sleep suggest is that you would be replenished.That the motor learning and the recovery from exercise is going to happen early in the night.Okay.So we'll just pause there, and kind of shelve that for a moment and then we're gonna come back to it.But I wanna talk about REM sleep, or rapid eye movement sleep.REM sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, as I mentioned before, occurs throughout the night, but you're gonna have more of it.A larger percentage of these 90 minute sleep cycles is going to be comprised of REM sleep as you get toward morning.REM sleep is fascinating.It was discovered in '50s when a sleep laboratory in Chicago, the researchers observed that people's eyes were moving under their eyelids.Now, something very important that we're going to address when we talk about trauma later is that, the eye movements are not just side to side they're very erratic in all different directions.One thing that I don't think I've never heard anyone really talk about publicly is, why eye movements during sleep, right?Eyes are closed.And sometimes people's eyelids will be a little bit open and their eyes are darting around, especially in little kids.I don't suggest you do this.I'm not even sure it's ethical.But, it has been done where you, you know, pull back the eyelids of a kid while they're sleeping and their eyes are kind of darting all over the place.I think people do this to their passed out friends at parties and things like that.So again, I don't suggest you do it, but I'm telling you it because it's been done before and therefore you don't have to do it again.But rapid eye movement sleep is fascinating and occurs because there are connections between the brainstem, an area called the pons, and areas of the thalamus and the top of the brain stem that are involved in generating movements in different directions, sometimes called saccades.\", start_char_idx=None,

sleep and dreaming that occur later in the night or toward morning?Well, okay, that’s an interesting question.There'S a lot of facets to it.There is some evidence that the first four hours of sleep are very important for memory processing and in fact, if you've learned something new that day or have experienced a new sensory motor experience, then your early sleep dreams will incorporate that experience.Much more than the later sleep dreams later, as that memory gets Consolidated from the early structures, which are the hippocampus deep in the temporal lobe to the cortex in a distributed fashion.That memory seems to move from that hippocampus to the cortex and also the dreams that incorporate that memory also move later in the night.So nobody knows why, but it does.There was a great study by siddarta Ribeiro who studied the consolidation of memories from the cortex from the hippocampus to the cortex in a rat across the period of a full day.Sleep because rats sleep in the daytime and he found that each subsequent Rim sleep period, moved that memory, a from the hippocampus to the first first area, that projects to it and then the second area.And then the third area.And you can see the memory moving Um through the throughout the Sleep cool period, yeah very cool, so you have to read that study.So um there's a number of different hormones associated with the different stages of sleep.We know that melatonin is a hormone of nighttime of nighttime.That makes a sleepy um what about growth hormone release when does that occur during sleep, so growth hormone release happens all day, long and all night long, but the Deep, slow way sleep that you get.The very first sleep cycle is when you get a big bolus of growth, hormone release and in men and women equally, and if you miss that first deep, slow way sleep period, you also miss that big bolus of growth hormone release and you might get ultimately across The day, just as much overall growth hormone release, but
